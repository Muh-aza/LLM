# A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models in Mining Gene Relations and Pathway Knowledge
   About 

This comprehensive study evaluates the efficacy of 21 large language models (LLMs), both API-based and open-source, in mining gene relations and pathway knowledge from extensive biomedical literature. Focusing on gene regulatory relations such as activation, inhibition, and phosphorylation, alongside KEGG pathway component recognition, the research reveals significant performance disparities among the models. API-based models, particularly GPT-4 and Claude-Pro, demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency, showcasing their potential as powerful tools in biomedical research. The study also explores the implications of model selection and prompt design for enhancing biomedical knowledge extraction. Our findings offer valuable insights for researchers in selecting and utilizing LLMs effectively for gene network analysis and pathway mapping, contributing to advancements in understanding disease mechanisms and drug development. The full methodology, data, and code are accessible on our GitHub repository
